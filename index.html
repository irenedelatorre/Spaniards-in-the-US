        Spanish nationals that live outside Spain for more than a year are asked
        by the Government to register in a General Consulate. If they are of
        voting age, they become part of the Electoral Census of Spaniards
        Residing Abroad (CERA). Although it is up to the person to do so, the
        CERA dataset, incomplete and changing in nature, provides a snapshot of
        where Spaniards study, work, or form a family abroad.

            The CERA data only
            indicates which consulate Spanish citizens registered in, but not
            where they specifically live. We can assume people cluster around the
            consulates, often located in big cities and home to universities and
            technology hubs that attract researchers, professionals, and students
            alike.

          When Spaniards discuss migration, they typically view it from the
          perspective of Spain being the destination. However, Spaniards can
          also be immigrants: whether they experienced exile decades ago or
          pursued better job opportunities abroad to navigate financial crises.
          Even today, many continue to travel to broaden their professional and
          personal horizons. They are the fortunate ones who choose to 
          live an adventure beyond their homeland.

        <p>I never thought I would be an immigrant myself. But in 2015, I 
          became one when I relocated to Boston to pursue a Master of 
          Fine Arts. Seeking to understand my experience, I became 
          fascinated by the Electoral Census of Spaniards Residing Abroad 
          (CERA), where Spanish nationals must register if they plan to 
          live outside Spain for more than a year. Suddenly, I became a number.

          Migration is a multifaceted experience, offering both freedom and 
          loneliness. It provides an opportunity for reinvention, away 
          from the constraints of familiarity. It is a time of discovery, 
          not only for oneself but also for those who become part of the 
          journey: friends, family, or colleagues, among many others. 
          Together, we navigate the nuances of what we miss from home, 
          what remains unchanged, and what is better in our new home. 
          Migration is not a binary experience—it exists in shades of gray.
        </p>

          To provide a wider representation of this view, I reached out 
          to fellow Spaniards who currently live or have lived across different
          parts of the United States. I asked them about what they missed from 
          Spain and their newfound joys. This infographic delves into the 
          complexities of Spanish migration in the United States: from the 
          cold statistical data to the challenges and achievements of those who 
          embark on the journey of seeing how their culture intersects with another.

        Spanish nationals that live outside Spain for more than a year are asked
        by the Government to register in a General Consulate. If they are of
        voting age, they become part of the Electoral Census of Spaniards

        in the US, each covering
        <span class="highlight-consulate">different jurisdictions</span>.
        The CERA data only
        indicates which consulate Spanish citizens registered in, but not
        where they specifically live. We can assume people cluster around the
        consulates, often located in big cities and home to universities and
        technology hubs that attract researchers, professionals, and students
        alike.

            When Spaniards discuss migration, they typically view it from the
            perspective of Spain being the destination. However, they can
            be immigrants too: whether they experienced exile decades ago or
            pursued better job opportunities abroad to navigate financial crises.
            Even today, many continue to travel to broaden their professional and
            personal horizons. They are the fortunate ones who, instead of 
            being forced to leave, <italic>choose</italic> to 
            live an adventure beyond their homeland.

          I never thought I would be an immigrant myself. But in 2015, I 
          became one when I relocated to Boston to pursue a Master of 
          Fine Arts. Seeking to understand my experience, I became 
          fascinated by the Electoral Census of Spaniards Residing Abroad 
          (CERA), where Spanish nationals must register if they plan to 
          live outside Spain for more than a year. Suddenly, I became a 
          number.

          Migration is a multifaceted experience, offering both freedom and 
          loneliness. It provides an opportunity for reinvention, away 
          from the constraints of familiarity. It is a time of discovery, 
          not only for oneself but also for those who become part of the 
          journey: friends, family, or colleagues, among many others. 
          Together, we navigate the nuances of what we miss from home, 
          what remains unchanged, and what is better in our new home. 
          Migration is not a binary experience—it exists in shades of gray.
        </p>
        <p>
          To provide a wider representation of this view, I reached out 
          to fellow Spaniards who currently live or have lived across 
          different parts of the United States. I asked them about what they 
          missed from Spain and their newfound joys. This project delves 
          into the complexities of Spanish migration in the United States: 
          from the cold statistical data to the challenges and achievements 
          of those who embark on the journey of seeing how their culture 
          intersects with another.
